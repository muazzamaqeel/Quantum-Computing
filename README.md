# Quantum-Computing


This repository is a place to:

Document my learning and progress in quantum computing.
Share any projects, examples, and notes I've created or gathered related to quantum computing.
Provide code samples that simulate quantum algorithms, using libraries like Quantum++ or Qiskit

Projects - Current Plan
Quantum Algorithms: Implementations of basic quantum algorithms such as Grover's search algorithm, Shor's algorithm, and others.
Cryptography: Exploration of quantum-based cryptography techniques, such as quantum key distribution (QKD).


Future Work
Adding more quantum computing algorithms and concepts.
Integration with real quantum computers via Qiskit.
Advanced topics like quantum error correction and quantum cryptography.
